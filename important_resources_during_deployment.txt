Flask-SocketIO compatibility with GUnicorn and Nginx:
https://flask-socketio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment.html
Use gunicorn --worker-class eventlet -w 1 module:app
Also remember, https://socket.io/docs/v4/reverse-proxy/

Points to remember:
Install GUnicorn
Set it up
Install Nginx
Set it up (go the sites-enabled, sites-available route, create these folders if they don't exist, Google regarding this.)
Get a certbot certificate
MAKE SURE TO PORT FORWARD HTTP AND HTTPS
