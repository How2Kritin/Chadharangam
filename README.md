# To run the server:

## First time setup:
### For Linux:
1. First, create a virtual environment for python using ```virtualenv .venv``` in your current directory.
2. Now, activate this virtual environment using ```source .venv/bin/activate``` for Bash.

For Windows:
1. First, create a virtual environment for python using ```python -m venv .venv``` in your current directory.
2. Now, activate this virtual environment by typing ```.venv\Scripts\activate```.

Continue with these:
3. Now, install the required libraries by running ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` while in the virtual environment.
4. Deactivate this virtual environment by typing ```deactivate```.

## Every other time:
1 (Linux). Activate the virtual environment using ```source .venv/bin/activate``` for Bash.
1 (Windows). Activate the virtual environment by typing ```.venv\Scripts\activate```.
2. Now, run "python app.py" to start the server up.
